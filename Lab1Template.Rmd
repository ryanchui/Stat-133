This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Once you have read the above, you can eliminate it from your Rmd file.

## Introduction

You are to fill in the R code chunks with code that will answer each of the questions.
As you work on answering the following questions you can run a single code chunk
by clicking on the "Run" button above, or by holding down the Command key and 
hitting return.  As you work, you will occassionally want to run all of the code in
the document to make sure that your document knits properly. 
 

For this lab, you will work with the rnorm() function, one of the random number generators in R. 
The rnorm() function is very handy for generating random values from the normal curve.

1. Use the following information about you to generate some random values:  
a.  Use set.seed(19930813) to set the seed, where the number in the parentheses 
is the four-digit year, two-digit month, and two-digit day you were born.
b.  Set the mean to 17 and the standard deviation to 3.
d.  Generate either 14 random values.
e.  Assign the values to the variable called samp1.
f.	Print the values generated.

```{r}
set.seed(19930813)
samp1 = rnorm(14, mean = 17, sd =3)
samp1
```


2. Create a vector called "normsamps" containing 1000 random samples 
from a normal distribution with mean 1 and SD 2.  

```{r}
normsamps <- rnorm(1000, mean = 1, sd = 2)
```

3. Calculate the mean and sd of the 1000 values in normsamps.
The mean of the values in normsamps is `r 1 + 3` and the SD is `r  6 - 2`.
(You are to replace the expressions 1 + 3 and 6 - 2 with the appropriate 
R expressions to compute these requested information.)

```{r}
mean(rnorm(1000, mean = 4, sd = 4))
sd(rnorm(1000, mean = 4, sd = 4))
```

4. Use implicit coercion of logical to numeric to calculate
the fraction of the values in normsamps that are less than 3.

```{r}
as.numeric(normsamps < 3)
```


5. Look up the help for rnorm(). You will see a few other functions listed,
such as pnorm(), dnorm(), and qnorm().  
Determine which one of these functions to use to check your answer above.
That is, find the area under the normal(1, 2) curve to the left of 3.  
This is the chance of getting a random value less than 3. 

```{r}
?rnorm
pnorm(3, mean=1, sd=2)
```


6.  What is the farthest distance from the center of the normal(1, 2)
curve in your sample, i.e., what is furthest distance from 1? 
(You may want to use the abs() and max() functions to help determine this.)  
Assign this distance to the variable called sampMaxDev.

```{r}
sampMaxDev <- max(normsamps)
sampMaxDev
```


7. Find the chance of observing a value as far as or farther from 1 as the value in sampMaxDev.
That is, find the area under the normal(1, 2) curve that is at least sampMax 
greater than 1 or at least sampMax less than 1. 
You will want to use one of the functions pnorm, dnorm, and qnorm again.

```{r}
?rnorm
2 * pnorm(sampMaxDev, lower.tail=F)
```

8. Make a histogram of the values in normsamps (use the hist() function).
Use the argument called main to add a title to your plot and the xlab
argument to label the x-axis.
Specify the breaks argument to control the number of bins in the histogram.

```{r}
hist(normsamps ,main = "Probability distribution", xlab = "Values", breaks = 60)
```


Once you have completed these tasks, make sure that you have included 
your name at the top of this document and that the document can be knitted.
Then, upload the Rmd file to bcourses.  
You have until **midnight Monday night** to upload the file.
